                    The Arctic Ocean is the smallest and shallowest of the world's five major oceans. It spans an 
                    area of approximately 14,060,000 km2 (5,430,000 sq mi) and is known as one of the coldest of oceans. 
                    The International Hydrographic Organization (IHO) recognizes it as an ocean, although some oceanographers 
                    call it the Arctic Mediterranean Sea. It has also been described as an estuary of the Atlantic Ocean.
                     It is also seen as the northernmost part of the all-encompassing World Ocean.

                The Arctic Ocean includes the North Pole region in the middle of the Northern Hemisphere and extends south to about 60°N. 
                The Arctic Ocean is surrounded by Eurasia and North America, and the borders follow topographic features: the Bering 
                Strait on the Pacific side and the Greenland Scotland Ridge on the Atlantic side. It is mostly covered by 
                sea ice throughout the year and almost completely in winter. The Arctic Ocean's surface temperature and 
                salinity vary seasonally as the ice cover melts and freezes; its salinity is the lowest on average of 
                the five major oceans, due to low evaporation, heavy fresh water inflow from rivers and streams, and 
                limited connection and outflow to surrounding oceanic waters with higher salinities. The summer shrinking 
                of the ice has been quoted at 50%. The US National Snow and Ice Data Center (NSIDC) uses satellite data 
                to provide a daily record of Arctic sea ice cover and the rate of melting compared to an average period 
                and specific past years, showing a continuous decline in sea ice extent. In September 2012, the Arctic 
                ice extent reached a new record minimum. Compared to the average extent (1979–2000), the sea ice had 
                diminished by 49%
