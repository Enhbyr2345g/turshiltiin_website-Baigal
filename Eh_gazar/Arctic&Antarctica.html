                <p>
                    The Arctic is a polar region located at the northernmost 
                    part of Earth. The Arctic region, from the IERS Reference Meridian travelling east, consists of 
                    parts of northern Norway (Nordland, Troms, Finnmark, Svalbard and Jan Mayen), northernmost Sweden 
                    (Västerbotten, Norrbotten and Lappland), northern Finland (North Ostrobothnia, Kainuu and Lappi), 
                    Russia (Murmansk, Siberia, Nenets Okrug, Novaya Zemlya), the United States (Alaska), Canada (Yukon, 
                    Northwest Territories, Nunavut), Danish Realm (Greenland), and northern Iceland (Grímsey and Kolbeinsey), 
                    along with the Arctic Ocean and adjacent seas. Land within the Arctic region has seasonally varying 
                    snow and ice cover, with predominantly treeless permafrost under the tundra. Arctic seas contain seasonal 
                    sea ice in many places.

                The Arctic region is a unique area among Earth's ecosystems. The cultures in the region and the Arctic 
                indigenous peoples have adapted to its cold and extreme conditions. Life in the Arctic includes 
                zooplankton and phytoplankton, fish and marine mammals, birds, land animals, plants and human societies.
                 Arctic land is bordered by the subarctic.

                <h2>
                    Antarctica
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Antarctica is Earth's southernmost and least-populated continent. 
                    Situated almost entirely south of the Antarctic Circle and surrounded by the Southern Ocean 
                    (also known as the Antarctic Ocean), it contains the geographic South Pole. Antarctica is the 
                    fifth-largest continent, being about 40% larger than Europe, and has an area of 14,200,000 km2 
                    (5,500,000 sq mi). Most of Antarctica is covered by the Antarctic ice sheet, with an average thickness 
                    of 1.9 km (1.2 mi).

                <h4>1</h4>
                Antarctica is, on average, the coldest, driest, and windiest of the continents, and it has the 
                highest average elevation. It is mainly a polar desert, with annual precipitation of over 200 mm (8 in) 
                along the coast and far less inland. About 70% of the world's freshwater reserves are frozen in 
                Antarctica, which, if melted, would raise global sea levels by almost 60 metres (200 ft). Antarctica 
                holds the record for the lowest measured temperature on Earth, −89.2 °C (−128.6 °F). The coastal regions 
                can reach temperatures over 10 °C (50 °F) in the summer. Native species of animals include mites, 
                nematodes, penguins, seals and tardigrades. Where vegetation occurs, it is mostly in the form of lichen 
                or moss.
            </p>
            <p>
                <h4>2</h4>
                The ice shelves of Antarctica were probably first seen in 1820, during a Russian expedition led by 
                Fabian Gottlieb von Bellingshausen and Mikhail Lazarev. The decades that followed saw further exploration 
                by French, American, and British expeditions. The first confirmed landing was by a Norwegian team in 1895. 
                In the early 20th century, there were a few expeditions into the interior of the continent. British 
                explorers Robert Falcon Scott and Ernest Shackleton were the first to reach the magnetic South Pole in 
                1909, and the geographic South Pole was first reached in 1911 by Norwegian explorer Roald Amundsen.
            </p>
            <p>
                <h4>3</h4>
                Antarctica is governed by about 30 countries, all of which are parties of the 1959 Antarctic Treaty System. 
                According to the terms of the treaty, military activity, mining, nuclear explosions, and nuclear waste 
                disposal are all prohibited in Antarctica. Tourism, fishing and research are the main human activities 
                in and around Antarctica. During the summer months, about 5,000 people reside at research stations, a 
                figure that drops to around 1,000 in the winter. Despite the continent's remoteness, human activity has 
                a significant effect on it via pollution, ozone depletion, and climate change. The melting of the 
                potentially unstable West Antarctic ice sheet causes the most uncertainty in century-scale projections of 
                sea level rise, and the same melting also affects the Southern Ocean overturning circulation, which can 
                eventually lead to significant impacts on the Southern Hemisphere climate and Southern Ocean productivity.
