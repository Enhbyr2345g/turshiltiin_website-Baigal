                </h2>
                <p>
                    Europe is a continent located entirely in the Northern Hemisphere and mostly in the 
                    Eastern Hemisphere. It is bordered by the Arctic Ocean to the north, the Atlantic Ocean 
                    to the west, the Mediterranean Sea to the south, and Asia to the east. Europe shares the 
                    landmass of Eurasia with Asia, and of Afro-Eurasia with both Asia and Africa. Europe 
                    is commonly considered to be separated from Asia by the watershed of the Ural Mountains, the 
                    Ural River, the Caspian Sea, the Greater Caucasus, the Black Sea, and the waterway of the Bosporus 
                    Strait

                <h4>1</h4>
                Europe covers about 10.18 million km2 (3.93 million sq mi), or 2% of Earth's surface (6.8% of land area), 
                making it the second-smallest continent (using the seven-continent model). Politically, Europe is divided 
                into about fifty sovereign states, of which Russia is the largest and most populous, spanning 39% of the 
                continent and comprising 15% of its population. Europe had a total population of about 745 million (about 
                10% of the world population) in 2021; the third-largest after Asia and Africa. The European climate 
                is affected by warm Atlantic currents, such as the Gulf Stream, which produce a temperate climate, 
                tempering winters and summers, on much of the continent. Further from the sea, seasonal differences are 
                more noticeable producing more continental climates.

                <h4>2</h4>
                European culture consists of a range of national and regional cultures, which form the central roots of 
                the wider Western civilisation, and together commonly reference ancient Greece and ancient Rome, 
                particularly through their Christian successors, as crucial and shared roots. Beginning with the 
                fall of the Western Roman Empire in 476 CE, Christian consolidation of Europe in the wake of the Migration 
                Period marked the European post-classical Middle Ages. The Italian Renaissance, radiating from Florence, 
                spread to the rest of the continent a new humanist interest in art and science which led to the modern 
                era. Since the Age of Discovery, led by Spain and Portugal, Europe played a predominant role in global 
                affairs with multiple explorations and conquests around the world. Between the 16th and 20th centuries, 
                European powers colonised at various times the Americas, almost all of Africa and Oceania, and the 
                majority of Asia.

            <p>
                <h4>3</h4>
                The Age of Enlightenment, the French Revolution, and the Napoleonic Wars shaped the continent culturally, 
                politically and economically from the end of the 17th century until the first half of the 19th century. 
                The Industrial Revolution, which began in Great Britain at the end of the 18th century, gave rise to 
                radical economic, cultural and social change in Western Europe and eventually the wider world. Both world 
                wars began and were fought to a great extent in Europe, contributing to a decline in Western European 
                dominance in world affairs by the mid-20th century as the Soviet Union and the United States took 
                prominence and competed over dominance in Europe and globally. The resulting Cold War divided 
                Europe along the Iron Curtain, with NATO in the West and the Warsaw Pact in the East. This divide 
                ended with the Revolutions of 1989, the fall of the Berlin Wall, and the dissolution of the Soviet 
                Union, which allowed European integration to advance significantly.

                <h4>4</h4>
                European integration is being advanced institutionally since 1948 with the founding of the Council of 
                Europe, and significantly through the realisation of the European Union (EU), which represents today the 
                majority of Europe. The European Union is a supranational political entity that lies between a 
                confederation and a federation and is based on a system of European treaties. The EU originated in 
                Western Europe but has been expanding eastward since the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991. A 
                majority of its members have adopted a common currency, the euro, and participate in the European single 
                market and a customs union. A large bloc of countries, the Schengen Area, have also abolished internal 
                border and immigration controls. Regular popular elections take place every five years within the EU; 
                they are considered to be the second-largest democratic elections in the world after India's. The EU 
                is the third-largest economy in the world..
