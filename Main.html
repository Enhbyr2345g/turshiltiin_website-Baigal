                            Earth is the third planet from the Sun and the only astronomical object known to harbor 
                            life. This is enabled by Earth being a water world, the only one in the Solar System sustaining 
                            liquid surface water. Almost all of Earth's water is contained in its global ocean, covering 
                            70.8% of Earth's crust. The remaining 29.2% of the Earth's crust is land, most of which is located 
                            in the form of continental landmasses within the Earth's land hemisphere. Most of Earth's land is 
                            somewhat humid and covered by vegetation, while large sheets of ice at Earth's polar deserts retain 
                            more water than Earth's groundwater, lakes, rivers and atmospheric water combined. Earth's crust 
                            consists of slowly moving tectonic plates, which interact to produce mountain ranges, volcanoes, 
                            and earthquakes. Earth has a liquid outer core that generates a magnetosphere capable of deflecting 
                            most of the destructive solar winds and cosmic radiation.

                    <h3>Land</h3>
                    <p>
                        Land, also known as dry land, ground, or earth, is the solid terrestrial surface of the Earth not 
                        submerged by the ocean or another body of water. It makes up 29.2% of the Earth's surface and includes 
                        all continents and islands. Earth's land surface is almost entirely covered by regolith, a layer of 
                        rock, soil, and minerals that forms the outer part of the crust. Land plays an important role in the 
                        Earth's climate system, being involved in the carbon cycle, nitrogen cycle, and water cycle. One-third 
                        of the land is covered in trees, another third is used for agriculture, and one-tenth is covered in 
                        permanent snow and glaciers. The remainder consists of desert, savannah, and prairie.

                    <h3>Ocean</h3>
                    <p>
                        The ocean is the body of salt water that covers ~70.8% of the Earth. In English, the term ocean 
                        also refers to any of the large bodies of water into which the world ocean is conventionally divided. 
                        Distinct names are used to identify five different areas of the ocean: Pacific, Atlantic, Indian, 
                        Antarctic/Southern, and Arctic. The ocean contains 97% of Earth's water  and is the primary 
                        component of the Earth's hydrosphere, thus the ocean is essential to life on Earth. The ocean influences 
                        climate and weather patterns, the carbon cycle, and the water cycle by acting as a huge heat reservoir.

                    <p>
                        Animals are multicellular, eukaryotic organisms in the biological kingdom Animalia. 
                        With few exceptions, animals consume organic material, breathe oxygen, have myocytes and are 
                        able to move, can reproduce sexually, and grow from a hollow sphere of cells, the blastula, 
                        during embryonic development. Animals form a clade, meaning that they arose from a single 
                        common ancestor.

                    <p>
                        Plants are the eukaryotes that form the kingdom Plantae; they are predominantly photosynthetic. 
                        This means that they obtain their energy from sunlight, using chloroplasts derived from endosymbiosis 
                        with cyanobacteria to produce sugars from carbon dioxide and water, using the green pigment 
                        chlorophyll. Exceptions are parasitic plants that have lost the genes for chlorophyll and 
                        photosynthesis, and obtain their energy from other plants or fungi.
